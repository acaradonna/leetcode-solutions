This is a pretty easy one to start the repo. 

The most efficient way (I believe?) to solve this is to just return the string directly.

Why use a variable to store the string in memory within the function, when we could just return the string literal and save the memory?

My js solution passes and beats 82% of solutions apparently - but my ts solution, which is nearly identical, beats 92% of solutions. I wonder if this is simply because fewer people have submitted solutions in ts? 

I'm not sure of a way to decrease runtime further for this one. This seems pretty optimal, but I wonder what those 8-18% of better solutions are doing differently?
